> Each night more than 45,000 people -- including 17,000 children -- experience homelessness. Currently 41,200 homeless men, women, and children bed down each night in municipal homeless shelters, and thousands more sleep rough on the streets or in other forms of shelter. Each year, more than 110,000 different homeless New Yorkers, including more than 40,000 children, sleep in the municipal shelter system.

## You can do this now:

* [_._ Write a letter to Mayor Bloomberg to set aside housing for homeless children](http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/page/speakout/one-in-three-solution?js=false)
* [_._ Plan a food drive](http://www.cityharvest.org/donate-food/donation-drives)
* [_._ Donate a virtual can](https://www.nyccah.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=7)
