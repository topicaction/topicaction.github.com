Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is an ongoing series of demonstrations initiated by the Canadian activist group Adbusters. OWS began September 17, 2011 in Zuccotti Park in New York City's Wall Street financial district. The protests are against social and economic inequality, high unemployment, and greed, as well as corruption and the undue influence of corporations — particularly from the financial services sector — on government.
